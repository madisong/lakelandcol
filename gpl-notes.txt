Sec 4.
======
"You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it,
in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
 copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this
 License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to
 the code"

 Same applies to modified works.

 This section says people may distribute covered works as long as they
 keep intact all license notices and any addtional terms that
 meet the requirements of section 7

 But section 7 says they can remove the addtional terms, if they so wish

 INCONSISTENCY
 
DOES SEC 7. NEGATE THIS REQUIREMENT TO KEEP ADDITIONAL TEMRS INTACT, BECAUSE IT
COMES AFTERWARD?

======
Sec 7.
======
This is allowed:

"Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by
works containing it"

Yet:

"When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when
you modify the work.)"

"Covered" meaning modified or unmodified.

HOW TO PREVENT THIS?
Can an additional, non-remvable, term be added that states that the statement
that I created this program, or that this work is based off of my program be
added?

Sec 11.
=======
Cant sue for patent violation.

i.e. if it says in the source: "this code
was written by me", and someone removes and
replaces it with their name, I cannot sue them
